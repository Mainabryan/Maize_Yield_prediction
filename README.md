# Maize_Yield_prediction
Machine Learning model to predict maize yield in Kenya using Ridge Regression, plus Tableau dashboards
# 🌾 Kenya Maize Yield Prediction using Ridge Regression

This project explores how Machine Learning can help predict **maize crop yield** based on key agricultural factors like rainfall, soil quality, fertilizer usage, and pest attacks. The goal is to support farmers, NGOs, and policymakers in making data-informed decisions for food security and sustainable agriculture.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Inconsistent yields across different Kenyan regions impact farmer income and national food stability. This project uses a realistic agricultural dataset to predict **current maize yield (in tonnes per hectare)** and identify **key factors that influence it**.

## 📈 Tableau Visualizations (In Progress)

The Tableau dashboard will help visualize insights like:

- 📍 Yield distribution across **Kenyan counties/regions**
- 🌦️ Correlation between **rainfall/fertilizer and yield**
- 🚜 Manual vs Mechanized farming yield comparison
- 🐛 Effect of **pest attacks** on yield
- 🔁 Trends between previous and current season yield

✅ I will screen-record the dashboard and link the video here once done.

## 🧪 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Load & Explore Dataset
2. Clean missing values
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Split dataset (Train/Test)
5. Feature Scaling
6. Train Ridge Regression
7. Evaluate model (RMSE, R²)
8. Interpret feature coefficients
9. Visualize results in Tableau

## 📦 Dataset

- Generated manually with realistic agricultural data
- Includes data from real Kenyan regions: Nyanza, Rift Valley, Western, Central, Eastern, Coast
- Simulates historical yield trends and regional diversity
